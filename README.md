# Edelbaum-Approximation

Purpose: calculate fuel consumption and time for low thrust orbit transfer (300km to 550km) for a starlink satallite.

1. See notebook for code, demonstrating my progression with the algorithm to get the final results.
2. See Results to see the final calculations and plots.
